An SVM (Support Vector Machine) can work for detection & classification of real vs AI-generated images, but by itself itâ€™s not the most promising choice for state-of-the-art results.

ðŸ”¹ Why SVM Can Work

Good with small/medium datasets â€“ SVMs perform well when you donâ€™t have millions of images.

High-dimensional features â€“ If you use deep features (like ResNet50 embeddings) as input, SVMs can separate real vs AI-generated fairly well.

Robust margins â€“ The max-margin principle of SVM makes it resistant to overfitting (compared to plain logistic regression).

ðŸ”¹ Limitations

Not state-of-the-art â€“ CNNs, Vision Transformers (ViT, Swin Transformer, EfficientNet), or hybrid approaches outperform SVMs in large-scale AI image detection.

Feature dependency â€“ Raw pixel input to SVM is weak. You must use handcrafted (LBP, GLCM, DCT) or deep extracted features.

Scalability issues â€“ Training time and memory cost grow quadratically with dataset size (not ideal for 100k+ images).

ðŸ”¹ Performance in Research

Studies show SVM with handcrafted features (LBP, DCT, PRNU noise, etc.) achieves 70â€“85% accuracy on datasets like FaceForensics++.

Deep features + SVM (e.g., ResNet50 embeddings fed into SVM) can reach 90â€“95% accuracy.

Modern deep networks (Swin Transformer, EfficientNet, ViT) trained end-to-end often reach 97â€“99% accuracy, especially on GAN-generated faces.
